# kepler_globals
Bayesian modeling of exoplanet demographics and population global parameters using the Kepler data! 
This code takes posterior outputs from PhoDyMM (Ragozzine et al. 2020) and thins them, adding dozens of calculated parameters.
Then, it calculates non-parameterized 3D histogram weights using emcee (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013) to model the true underlying exoplanet distribution.
